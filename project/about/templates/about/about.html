                        Fixmykix is an online marketplace for Shoe Restoration and Shoe Customization. Promoting creative entrepreneurship through custom fashion, while also highlighting the value of restoration in today's modern world plagued with fast fashion. The idea of Fixmykix was born when James Green, Co-Founder of Fixmykix, was restoring shoes at the age of 15 as a side hustle to keep money in his pockets. Around this time James joined a program called The Hidden genius Project. The Hidden Genius Project trains and mentors black male youth in Technology Creation, Entrepreneurship, and Leadership skills to transform their lives and communities. In this 15 Month program James was encouraged to create an app, He wasn't sure what type of app to build until one day his Co-Founder Sean Valentine had the idea of an online marketplace for Shoe Restoration and Customization and said to James,  “You can’t clean every pair of shoes yourself James, But every pair of shoes can be cleaned.”  After having that conversation James set on a journey to figuring out how he could bring Fixmykix to life.

                        You know those worn down shoes sitting under your bed that your about to throw away? DON’T! 300 Million pairs of shoes are thrown out to sit in the landfill each year and they don't need to be. Shoe Restoration is the process of repairing a pair of shoes to a “like new” condition. Shoe Restoration has always been around, Our grandparents would walk there “Sunday’s Best” to the local Cobbler down the street, But, like many things the trade is evolving. In the most recent years Shoe Restoration has been used to preserve the life of Sneakers. Whether its a historical pair of 1985 Jordan 1’s or just your favorite pair of Vans, Modern day Cobblers have been leveraging social media to run their business rather than the traditional brick & mortar. Fixmykix is making these Modern day Cobblers we call Shoe Restoration Technicians services more accessible to you!

                        Shoe Custom culture has been around since back to early hip hop and punk rock era of the 1980s, a form of self expression among the misunderstood young people. Now more than ever our world is experiencing a generation of young people that use fashion as a medium for self expression. Shoe Customization is another art form, using a pair of shoes as a canvas and creating your own vision for a shoe. Making a shoe yours by creating a pair of shoes that resembles who you are. These services are already out there, Fixmykix is making it more accessible for anyone with access.
